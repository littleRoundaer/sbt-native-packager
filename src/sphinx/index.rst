.. highlights:: **"Code once, deploy anywhere"**

The sbt-native-packager attempts to make building packages for different operating systems easier.  While it provides
some basic abstractions around packaging, it also allows you to dig down into the nuts and bolts of each platform as
needed to generate the best package possible.

Read the :ref:`introduction` to learn how native-packager works. The :ref:`getting-started` guide will help you set up
your first package. The :ref:`packaging-formats` and :ref:`archetypes` sections explain the different plugins in more
detail, which :ref:`recipes` provides solutions for common configurations.
